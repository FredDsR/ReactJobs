# React Jobs

Project from this [guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDB4uaJ87e0) that I find to learn a React in 2024.

## How to Run

After clone this repository, you need to run the command `npm install --include=dev`, to install the dependencies.

To run the backend service you need to run `npm run server`.

To run the frontend service you need to run (within another terminal) `npm run build` and `npm run preview`.

After that, you will be able to check this little projetct out :)

There is some print screens of the frontend (the design isn't mine)
